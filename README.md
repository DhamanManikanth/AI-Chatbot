### Key Features

* **Interactive Chat UI**: A responsive, user-friendly interface with a chat input box at the bottom.
* **AI Model Integration**: The app connects to the **Mistral-7B-Instruct** model via the Hugging Face Inference API to generate real-time, knowledgeable responses.
* **Model Selection**: Users can choose between different versions of the Mistral model using a sidebar dropdown.
* **Conversational Experience**: Messages are displayed with distinct avatars (ðŸ§‘ for the user and ðŸ¤– for the AI), and the AI's responses are streamed to the screen, providing a dynamic "typing" effect.
* **Conversation Management**: The app includes a "Clear Chat History" button to reset the conversation and an "Export" button to download the full chat log as a text file.
* **Version Control**: The project is set up with Git and hosted on a GitHub repository for easy collaboration and version management.
